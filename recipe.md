###DIRECTIONS  
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.

Brush both sides of each tortilla with a light layer of vegetable oil and cut into 8 wedges (or other shapes as desired). Place the tortilla pieces in a single layer on a baking tray (you may need two trays), sprinkle with salt and bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8-10 minutes.

In the meantime, start making the refried beans. Drain the black beans and rinse thoroughly. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Finely chop the coriander leaves. Put the oil into the frying pan on a high hear, add the garlic and fry until it starts to turn golden, then add the beans, cumin, coriander, Tamara and lime juice. Using the back of a wooden spoon, start mashing the beans, while continuing to fry for 2 minutes, adding a little water to prevent the beans from sticking to the pan. Add half the chopped fresh coriander leaves, mix through and remove from the heat.

Once the tortillas have browned, remove from the oven and leave too cool.

Now make your salsa. Peel and roughly chop the garlic, finely slice the scallions and put them both into a food processor with the rest of the salsa ingredients. Blend until smooth and set aside.

Peel the red onion and chop into the half-moon-shaped slices. Remove the avocado from its skin and chop into small bite-size pieces. Cut the chilli into thin strips - if you want it milder, remove the seeds first.

Now assemble your nacho bowl. Tip the crispy tortilla shapes in first, then pour over the refried beans. Now add the fun stuff - the nacho cheese (recipe on our youtube channel), avocado, onions and salsa (if you want the tortillas to remain crunchy serve the salsa on the side). Chop the fresh coriander finely and sprinkle on top with some black sesame seeds and the sliced red chilli. You can also serve this in individual bowls if it's not a sharing plate. Make sure everyone gets all the toppings! Serves 4 as a sharing plate and 2 as a dinner.
